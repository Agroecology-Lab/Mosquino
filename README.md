As it is a derviative of the [Mosquito](https://community.simplefoc.com/t/mosquito-board-new-design/1621/22?u=sam) board the [Mosquito manual](https://drive.google.com/file/u/1/d/1Ev1wcCPXnmiUsTl4JunoNijvsclqJlB7/view) should largely apply

Suitable motors might include [GB2208 from T-motor](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c35e97nl) It is designed to be plug and play with encoders from [Small robots on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/stores/smallrobots/)
